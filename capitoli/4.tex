% This is a form of unsupervised learning, in the sense that the learner does not distinguish the class variable from the attribute
% variables in the data. The objective is to induce a network (or a set of networks) that “best describes” the probability distribution over the training data. This optimization process is implemented in practice by using heuristic search techniques to find the best candidate over the space of possible networks. The search process relies on a scoring function that assesses the merits of each candidate network.
